Bekaltal and Brahmatal. Brahmatal is at the highest point of trek and is surrounded by snow covered meadows which makes it a picture perfect setting and a heavenly experience to witness first hand. The Brahmatal top offers exhilarating views of the most coveted glimpse of Mt. Trishul and Mt. Nanda Ghunti at close range.",

The trek passes through virgin fields of Spiti Valley and small hamlets giving glimpses into the culture of the valley. One will also find itself in the vicinity of Key Monastery, a medieval monastery which gives a peek into the history of Tibetan Buddhist culture. If one notice carefully, many fossils can also be found en route to the top. The top of the world view gets one reaches at the peak can surely not be put in words, all the peaks visible at the eye level as if one has levitated far over the surface of Earth. One finds Pin Parvati Pass, ranges of Kinnaur among others. Don\u2019t forget to get your picture clicked on your way back, at Hikkim, which is the home to Highest Post Office in the World.",

The trek from Gaumukh to Tapovan is a tough one as it involves crossing boulders and a rough terrain marked with moraines all through the way. At Tapovan one gets a magnificent view of Mt. Shivling; tall, snow clad mountain from its base to the summit standing in its entirety, makes one skip a beat for the moment. This is no doubt one of the best mountain views one can experience in his lifetime. One can also view Sudarshan Parbat and Bhagirathi Peaks from Tapovan.",

Welcome to the Valley of Flowers. The trek is Botanist\u2019s dream come true and no less a dream for anyone else. The trek is an easy one with people of all ages needing nothing more than a will to visit a one of a kind experience. The trek can be experienced at its best during rainy season (July, August, September) when the valley exuberates flowers in all forms and colours. One also gets a chance to visit Sikh Pilgrimage, Hemkund Sahib Gurudwara where one can visit the holy shrine and experience the waters of clear, pristine and chilly Hemkund and enjoy a delicious meal at the Gurudwara",

The trek offers one of the sharpest contrast in its landscape which ranges from cold, dry mountainous regions in Spiti to Parvati valley with its rich biodiversity and wide range of flora and fauna. The trek consists of crossing multiple glacial streams and Pin river along the way to Pin base camp which is 1000ft below the pass. The glacial pass offers great views of Parvati South Ridge, Kullu Makalu, Kinner Kailash among others. The descent from Pass is equally challenging with boulder laden way and marshy regions, on further descent one finds greenery in the Parvati valley the region feels like a blessing after trek in the arid region. After the river crossings and trail through pastures during the end of the trek, one finds hot water springs at Kheerganga which is nothing less than a sauna experience after such a long trek and a perfect reward for the journey traversed",

Kumbhakarna and Kanchenjunga along with other peaks. The trail passes through Nepal and India where you would find yourself to be at the border of India and Nepal without knowing it. The stays at teahouse and walk through stone laden paths lined with Rhododendrons and Magnolia is a memorable experience. The ridges, alpine meadows and great views of Darjeeling, Nepal from top will never fail to keep you in awe and if you are lucky enough you might see Red Panda along the way at Singalila National Park",

The trail passes through villages, thick canopy of birch trees, small meadows and multiple rivulets that adds to the thrill of the trek. On the top is the lake Prashar, regarded as a sacred lake where sage Prashar had once meditated. On the side of the lake is a beautiful Pagoda style Prashar Temple. It is made of deodar wood. Pilgrims from India and across the world throng this place particularly during the annual festival held in the month of June. The exact history of the Parashar Temple is unknown, but according to folklores, it took around 18 years to complete its construction. Many also believe that the architecture belongs to that of the 14th century and was commissioned by Ban Sen, the king of Mandi. An oval shaped lake with majestic view of the Dhauladhar Range, Pir Pinjal and Kinnaur Range in the backdrop will leave you scrambling for jaws off the floor for sure.",

The highlights of the trek includes one of the best campsites with each location offering a different view of the nature and a good snow to cherish which starts at 10,000ft. The glamour starts right from the time when one takes a drive from Dehradun to its base camp. One of the least travelled road, not a metaphor, in the area surrounded with forest cover and lakes. The trek passes through apple orchards, rhododendron trees, dense forests; meadows covered with snow and surrounded by Pine trees which is also a resting site. For skiing enthusiasts, the trek offers good but small patches to ski on while on the trek. The top of Kedarkantha offers 360 degree view of frosty peaks of Himalayas with Dhauladhar range, Har ki Dun valley, Rupin Valley to name a few. While descending from Kedarkantha, one comes across Judas ka Talab, a picturesque location with a small pond surrounded by tall Pine Trees and good views of Swargarohini and Har ki Dun valley.",

But to forewarne you, read no further if you are a beginner or care for your life while on treks. This trek is about harsh temperature(-10 to -35 degrees), sleeping in caves and a strong current of water flowing below few inches of ice that support you and might fail you. This trek involves walking on ice and a chance to see first hand how it is On the Other Side of The WALL. But this is undoubtedly the most unique trek and a nature's magnum opus. And the trek in recent years has become an endangered activity owing to a road being carved out in the mountains. It is a classic example of resourcefulness of the natives.

At 20,500 feet Stok Kangri is the highest trekkable summit in India (6,153 m). Being in the 6000+ club, it is a difficult trek to do and is not recommended for first-timers and requires a good deal of acclimatization at every stage. It has a good deal of eye soaking views with Hemis National Park, known for its Snow Leopard, and a walk through the cold desert of Ladakh. The base camp has many water bodies in it but the real thrill comes on the final day of the trek to summit. It follows a great change in altitude with a snow covered trail which is rewarded with a beautiful view of Karakoram range on the north and Zanskar Ranges in the south.",
